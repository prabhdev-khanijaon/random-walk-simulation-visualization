Random Walk Simulation Visualization

Overview:
This project is a Python-based random walk simulation that visualizes the path of a particle taking a series of random steps. The random walk is a fundamental concept in fields like physics, biology, finance, and data science, making it a great tool for understanding stochastic processes. The simulation helps visualize how a particle moves in random directions over time, allowing users to observe the emergence of patterns (or the lack thereof) in the random walk.

Features:
2D Visualizations: Visualize the random walk in two dimensions.
Customizable Parameters: Easily modify the number of steps, dimensions, and other parameters to explore different random walk scenarios.
Interactive Plots: Use Plotly for interactive visualizations, allowing users to zoom in, pan, and explore the path.

Technologies Used:
Python 3.12.3
Matplotlib: For static 2D visualizations.
Plotly: For interactive 2D visualizations.

Applications:
Finance: Simulate stock price movements using the random walk hypothesis.
Physics: Model particle diffusion and Brownian motion.
Biology: Visualize animal foraging patterns or the movement of molecules in cellular environments.
Data Science: Learn how random processes evolve over time and observe emergent patterns.

How to Use:
Clone the Repository:
Copy following code to bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-walk-simulation-visualization.git
Install Dependencies:
Copy following code to bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Simulation:
Copy following code to bash

Customize Parameters: Modify the configuration file or pass arguments to the script to change the number of steps or dimensions.

Visualizations
2D Walk: Shows a random walk in two dimensions, with the option to trace multiple paths.
Interactive Plots: Use Plotly to zoom, pan, and explore the random walk in detail.

Future Enhancements
Live Animation: Implement real-time animation to show the progression of the random walk.
Higher Dimensions: Extend the simulation to 4D or higher to explore more abstract random walk models.
Statistical Summary: Calculate and display key statistics such as average distance from the origin, total displacement, and step variance.
Statistical Analysis: Include additional statistical measures such as variance and distribution histograms.
