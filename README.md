# Random Walk Simulation and Data Visualization
## Overview
This project demonstrates random walk simulations, visualizing the path of points as they randomly move across a grid. The random walk is a foundational concept in data science, physics, and various other fields where stochastic processes are analyzed. The project generates random walks, visualizes them using both Matplotlib and Plotly, and allows interactive exploration of the results.

The goal of this project is to showcase your data analysis skills through simulation, data visualization, and handling random processes in Python.

## Skills Demonstrated
Data Simulation: Created and analyzed random processes (random walks) in Python.

Data Visualization: Used both Matplotlib for static plots and Plotly for interactive visualizations.

Python Programming: Demonstrated object-oriented programming (OOP) through the RandomWalk class, along with proficient use of libraries such as Plotly and Matplotlib.

User Interaction: Incorporated user input to allow for iterative exploration of random walks.

## Key Features
### Random Walk Generation:
Generates a sequence of points that simulate a random walk.

Supports both 2D random walks using Matplotlib and Plotly for visualization.

### Interactive Visualizations:
Creates interactive plots using Plotly to visualize the random walks.

Visualizes static plots using Matplotlib for a more traditional approach.

### User-Controlled Simulation:
Allows the user to repeatedly generate new random walks and explore different walk patterns.

## Future Improvements
3D Random Walks: Extend the simulation to 3D space for more complex random walks.

Statistical Analysis: Analyze properties of the random walks, such as step distribution, average distance from the origin, and variance.

Real-Time Simulation: Implement real-time plotting of the walk, allowing the user to observe the process as it unfolds.
